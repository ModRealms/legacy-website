    <h3>Last Revision: 27th September 2021</h3>
    <p>By accessing any of our services, you accept and agree to be bound to our Terms of Service. We reserve the right to restrict access to our services at any time, without refund or notice. Additionally, we reserve the right to update our Terms of Service at anytime without warning. By using our services, you agree to periodically familiarize yourself with the recent Terms of Service.

    <ul>
        <li>We will regularly refer to ourselves as 'we' or 'our' throughout this document. Please note that this term is referencing ModRealms Limited alongside any directors, owners, volunteers or partners that are involved with upholding our services.</li>
        <li>We will regularly refer to our 'services' throughout this document. Please note that this term is referencing our Minecraft servers, websites and any external service that we make use of, such as Discord or Tebex.</li>
        <li>Please use common sense. If you think you are doing something within our services that might get you into trouble, it probably will.</li>
        <li>We do not have a minimum age requirement, however many related services (such as, but not limited to) Tebex and Discord require that you be of age to use them; you must uphold this. Discord requires that you are 13 or above in order to use the service, Tebex requires that you are 16 or above before purchasing a product.</li>
        <li>We make available our Network Rules within our Discord server and on our online forum. These rules are outlined to ensure the safety of all users that use our services, and are reflected across any service that we make use of.</li>
        <li>We will always aim to provide enough warning when a player does not respect our Network Rules, however this is not required and a user may be restricted from being able to access our services at any time if they are seen to be having a negative impact on our services or any user.</li>
        <li>We cannot guarantee (whilst this is our aim) 100% uptime for all of our services. Compensation for loss of time or access is not required, and is entirely at our discretion. We are not required to compensate for a loss of access to any paid service due to an outage.
    </ul>
